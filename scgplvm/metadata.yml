description: In this notebook we follow (Buettner and Theis, 2012) and use the GP-LVM
  to analyze some single cell data from (Guo et al., 2010). They performed qPCR TaqMan
  array on single cells from the developing blastocyst in mouse. The data is taken
  from the early stages of development when the Blastocyst is forming. At the 32 cell
  stage the data is already separated into the trophectoderm (TE) which goes onto
  form the placenta and the inner cellular mass (ICM). The ICM further differentiates
  into the epiblast (EPI)---which gives rise to the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm---and
  the primitive endoderm (PE) which develops into the amniotic sack. Guo et al selected
  48 genes for expression measurement. They labelled the resulting cells and their
  labels are included as an aide to visualization.
