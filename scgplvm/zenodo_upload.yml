  description: In this notebook we follow (Buettner and Theis, 2012) and use the GP-LVM
    to analyze some single cell data from (Guo et al., 2010). They performed qPCR
    TaqMan array on single cells from the developing blastocyst in mouse. The data
    is taken from the early stages of development when the Blastocyst is forming.
    At the 32 cell stage the data is already separated into the trophectoderm (TE)
    which goes onto form the placenta and the inner cellular mass (ICM). The ICM further
    differentiates into the epiblast (EPI)---which gives rise to the endoderm, mesoderm
    and ectoderm---and the primitive endoderm (PE) which develops into the amniotic
    sack. Guo et al selected 48 genes for expression measurement. They labelled the
    resulting cells and their labels are included as an aide to visualization.
